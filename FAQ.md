- What about support for older Minecraft-Versions?
  - For now, i'll always support the latest version of Minecraft.
  - Supporting Multiple versions is not as easy as it sounds. In most cases, it'd require me to maintain multiple code-bases per mod, which is just out of scope for me (remember, this isn't my job. I don't earn a single penny out of this, and never will!)
- What about support for the Quilt-Loader?
  - In theory, all my fabric-mods should work out of the box for quilt (if what they claim is true)
  - If they don't, currently I won't consider adding separate support for it, for multiple reasons:
    - The same as above, it'd require me now also support a whole different loader, and sorry, but no.
    - I don't know of a single reason to use Quilt over Fabric, in terms of functionality. At least not for me.
    - There have been cases where the Moderators of the Official QuiltMC-Discord-Server have been trans/homophobic against users. And as I'm transgender, I definitely do not support such behavior. Duh.
    - Maybe in the future this decision changes, but I don't know yet.
- I have an idea of a mod. Can you do it?
  - Maybe. Send me a discord-dm (@kianadev) and we'll see.
